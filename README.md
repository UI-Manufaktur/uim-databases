A **database** is an **organized collection of structured information**, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

**Definition**:

- A database consists of:
  - **Data**: Organized into tables, rows, and columns.
  - **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software that manages the data, provides access control, and allows efficient querying.
- Together, the data and the DBMS form a **database system**.

**Common Characteristics**:

- **Structured Data**: Modeled in rows and columns within tables.
- **Efficient Access**: Data can be easily accessed, modified, and organized.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: Used for writing and querying data.

**Evolution of Databases**:

- **Navigational Databases**: Hierarchical and network models (1960s).
- **Relational Databases**: Popularized in the 1980s.
- **Object-Oriented Databases**: Emerged in the 1990s.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Developed for unstructured data and internet-scale applications.

**Difference Between Databases and Spreadsheets**:

- **Databases**:
  - Hold larger collections of organized information.
  - Allow multiple users to securely access and query data.
- **Spreadsheets (e.g., Excel)**:
  - Designed for individual users.
  - Suitable for simpler data manipulation.

**Types of Databases**:

- **Relational Databases**: Use tables with predefined schemas.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Handle unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Distributed Databases**: Span multiple servers or locations.
- **Object-Oriented Databases**: Store objects directly (e.g., Java objects).
- **Graph Databases**: Optimize for graph-like data structures.
- **Cloud Databases**: Hosted in the cloud.
